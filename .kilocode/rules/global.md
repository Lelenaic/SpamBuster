The project is a NextJS project and aims to be desktop only with ElectronJS.
The UI library is Shadcn UI with TailwindCSS and Tailwind Animate CSS.


# Documentation
Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask whenever you need it.
